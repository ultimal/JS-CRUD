# JS-CRUD
In an effort to create a solution for gathering information to design and deploy enterprise software, I had been looking for something that would help display customized tables and provide CRUD functionality. I also needed something that would allow two types of fields, text and dropdown. There wasn't anything out there that I could find would fill this need. So I put this library together.

## Introduction
This library provides an easy to deploy solution for CRUD tables.
